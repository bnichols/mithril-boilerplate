## Mithril Boilerplate

This is a quick starter template coupled with NodeJS build tools for projects that want to use Leo Horie's
[Mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/index.html) framework.

Features include:

+ Gulpfile included
+ Bower support
+ Browserify
+ LESS support (easily swapped with your preproc of choice)
+ LiveReload
+ Proxy middleware for localhost API
+ Connect fallback to browser history API (for pathname routes)

### Requirements

+ NodeJS
+ NPM
+ Bower

### Install and use

`npm install`

`gulp`

Now you should see the example Mithril app at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
